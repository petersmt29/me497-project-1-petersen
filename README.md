1. Make sure you read the activity on creating the README. You can find it at <https://github.com/DSR-RHIT/me497-reproducible-research/blob/master/cm/cm1012_edit-readme.md> 
2. Also, HTML files can be excused from version control, see my commenst os setting up gitignore  <https://github.com/DSR-RHIT/me497-reproducible-research/blob/master/cm/cm1009_gitignore.md> 
3. Look at the R Markdown cheat sheet by RStudio for any help you might need with the markup of your prose.  <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf>
